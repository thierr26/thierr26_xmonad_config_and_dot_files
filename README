This repository contains the author's xmonad configuration as well as other
"dot files" that the author has had to write to achieve a satisfactory
configuration.

xmonad is a tiling window manager. On a Debian GNU/Linux system, you can
install it and other useful packages for compiling a custom configuration with
the command (as root):

apt-get install xmonad ghc libghc-xmonad-dev libghc-xmonad-contrib-dev

If you are not familiar with xmonad and xmonad configuration, you may want to
read the following pages:

        - http://xmonad.org/about.html

        - http://xmonad.org/tour.html

        - http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Doc-Configuring.html

The author could write his configuration files with a lot of googling. Some
web pages have been particularly helpful:

        - https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Config_archive/John_Goerzen%27s_Configuration

        - http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/xmonad_layouts_for_netbooks/

==============================================================================
Precisely, the files in this repository are:

----------------------------------------------
.xinitrc

        Thanks to this file and the "xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr" command
        that it contains, the mouse cursor is the classical arrow instead of
        the default "X" cursor in some application (Claws Mail in particular).

----------------------------------------------
.Xresources

        This file sets some default parameters for xterm, xmessage and dclock.
        Most notably, the line:

        xmessage*international: true

        causes xmessage to display UTF-8 encoded messages properly.

        The line:

        XTerm*faceName: Inconsolata

        causes the font Inconsolata to be used in xterm. To install this font
        on a Debian GNU/Linux system, issue the command (as root):

        apt-get install fonts-inconsolata

----------------------------------------------
.moc/config, the MOC (music on console) configuration.

        The line:

        Shuffle = yes

        causes MOC to start with the shuffle mode enabled.

        To install MOC on a Debian GNU/Linux system, issue the command (as
        root):

        apt-get install moc

----------------------------------------------
.xbindkeysrc, the user configuration file for xbindkeys.

        It binds the multimedia keys of the keyboard to command lines. It has
        been tested with a Cherry Stream XT corded keyboard only. Hopefully it
        works on most other keyboards.

        The "volume up", "volume down" and "mute" keys are bound to amixer
        commands. On a Debian GNU/Linux system, amixer is available in the
        alsa-utils package.

        The "next track", "previous track" and "pause" keys are bound to MOC
        (music on console) commands. The "next track" key in particular is
        bound to a not so trivial command:

        mocp -S 2>/dev/null; if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then mocp -p; else mocp -f; fi;

        which causes MOC to play the next track if it is already running, or
        to be launched and start playing if it is not already running. If you
        have all your music in a single play list, and the MOC shuffle mode
        enabled in .moc/config, then you can have your music start playing in
        random order by pressing only the "next track" key and you never need
        to open the MOC interface.

        To install xbindkeys on a Debian GNU/Linux system, issue the command
        (as root):

        apt-get install xbindkeys

----------------------------------------------
.xmonad/xmonad.hs, the xmonad configuration.

        This file is heavily commented. Here is a description of the
        configuration:

                - The Mod key is bound to the Windows key (Mod4).

                - The key binding is adapted for AZERTY keyboards users.
                  Mod + semicolon is used to decrease the number of windows in
                  in the master pane (instead of Mod + period).

                - dmenu shows up at the bottom of screen instead of at the
                  top, and with specific colors.

                - Mod + left arrow and Mod + right arrow allow cycling through
                  the non-empty workspaces.

                - Mod + x triggers a command prompt.

                - Mod + shift + q and mod + q trigger a "system" menu
                  (Shutdown / Reboot / Exit / Lock / Restart XMonad).

                  Note that the Shutdown and Reboot commands won't work if the
                  user is not allowed to run "sudo poweroff" and "sudo reboot"
                  without password. To allow the users to run "sudo poweroff"
                  and "sudo reboot" without password, the system administrator
                  may add this line in /etc/sudoers using visudo:

                  ALL     ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/poweroff, /sbin/reboot

                  Not also that the Lock command launches xtrlock and thus
                  won't work if xtrlock is not installed on the system. On a
                  Debian GNU/Linux system, you can install it with the command
                  (as root):

                  apt-get install xtrlock

                - Mod + shift + m shows the title currently played by MOC
                  (music on console).

                - The workspaces are given names:
                  * 1:mail
                  * 2:web
                  * 3:chat
                  * 4:image1
                  * 5:image2
                  * 6:edit1
                  * 7:edit2
                  * 8:edit3
                  * 9:edit4

                - The names of the workspaces are briefly displayed when
                  switching between workspaces.

                - Some applications are automatically moved to particular
                  workspaces:
                  * Claws Mail to 1:mail,
                  * Iceweasel to 2:web,
                  * Gajim to 3:chat,
                  * xzgv to 4:image1,
                  * GIMP to 5:image2.

                - GIMP and xmessage are automatically moved to the floating
                  layer.

                - On xmonad startup or restart, the script .xmonad/hooks is
                  run with the "startup" argument which causes three
                  applications to be automatically launched, if they are
                  installed on the system and if they are not already run by
                  the user:
                  * dclock,
                  * Claws Mail,
                  * Iceweasel.

                  As already mentioned, Claws Mail and Iceweasel are
                  automatically moved to particular workspaces.

                  dclock is permanently displayed in the upper right corner of
                  the screen and shows the time and date. In the text of the
                  .xmonad/xmonad.hs file, it is assumed that the screen is
                  1920 pixels wide. If your screen is a different resolution,
                  then you probably want to replace 1920 with the pixel width
                  of your screen.

                  On a Debian GNU/Linux system, you can install dclock with
                  the command (as root):

                  apt-get install dclock

                  It is possible to partially or totally disable the script
                  .xmonad/hooks through environment variables definitions.
                  Please run the script .xmonad/hooks with the --help option
                  for more information.

                - There are two layouts available in each workspace : the
                  "fixed column" layout and the "full screen" layout. You can
                  switch between them with Mod + space.

                  In all but the four "edit" workspaces, the width of the
                  master pane in the "fixed column" layout is fixed to 80
                  characters, which is good for working in a terminal or
                  editing a file in (say) Vim with a 80 characters text width.

                  In the four "edit" workspaces, the width of the master pane
                  in the "fixed column" layout is fixed to 163 characters
                  which is good for editing two files side by side in Vim
                  (vertical split) with the foldcolumn option set to 1 and a
                  80 characters text width in both files.

                  You might want to try the Wibafoco Vim plugin which
                  automatically changes the foldcolumn option depending on the
                  Vim window width. This plugin is available here:

                  https://github.com/thierr26/wibafoco

----------------------------------------------
.xmonad/hooks, the shell script which is run on xmonad startup and restart
thanks to the 'execScriptHook "startup"' function call in .xmonad/xmonad.hs.

        When run with the "startup" argument, this script launches the
        following applications if they are installed on the system and if they
        are not already run by the user:
        * dclock,
        * Claws Mail,
        * Iceweasel.

        It is possible to partially or totally disable the script through
        environment variables definitions. Please run the script with the
        --help option for more information.

----------------------------------------------
install_thierr26_xmonad_config_and_dot_files, a shell script (actually a dash
script) to install the files.

        This script copies all the above files to the user's home directory or
        to the directory specified on the command line. Launch the script with
        the --help option for a more detailed documentation.

        Note that no backup of the overwritten files is done.
